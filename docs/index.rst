Welcome to Project Trellis
=========================================

`Project Trellis`_ documents the `Lattice`_ ECP5 architecture (and other related parts) to enable
development of open-source tools.  Our goal is to provide sufficient information
to develop a free and open Verilog to bitstream toolchain for these devices.
